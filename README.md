## üåê Networking Modes [NEEDS MORE ELABORATE INFO]

In Multipass, if you don‚Äôt specify a network (--network), the VM is attached to the default NAT network that Multipass creates.

The script allows you to choose between two networking modes:

### 1. NAT (default)

-   VM gets a private IP in a Multipass-managed NAT.\
-   Outbound internet works.\
-   Only accessible from host via `multipass shell` or
    `multipass exec`.\
-   Other devices on your LAN cannot reach it.

### 2. Bridged

-   VM is attached to a host network adapter (e.g., `eth0`, `wlp2s0`).\
-   VM gets an IP from your LAN, just like a physical machine.\
-   Accessible directly from other devices on the LAN.\
-   Requires choosing a valid adapter from `multipass networks`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

-   NAT mode is simpler and always works.\
-   Bridged mode requires a supported physical adapter.\
-   Multipass networking capabilities may vary by OS and backend.
